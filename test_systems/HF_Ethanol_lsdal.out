    Configuration:
    ==============
    This is an OpenMP calculation using   2 threads.
    This is a serial calculation (no MPI)

    You have requested Augmented Roothaan-Hall optimization
    => explicit averaging is turned off!

    Expand trust radius if ratio is larger than:            0.75
    Contract trust radius if ratio is smaller than:         0.25
    On expansion, trust radius is expanded by a factor      1.20
    On contraction, trust radius is contracted by a factor  0.70

    Maximum size of subspace in ARH linear equations:       2

    Density subspace min. method    : None                    
    Density optimization            : Augmented RH optimization          

    Maximum size of Fock/density queue in averaging:   10

    Convergence threshold for gradient        :   0.10E-03
    We have detected a Dunnings Basis set so we deactivate the
    use of the Grand Canonical basis, which is normally default.
    The use of Grand Canonical basis can be enforced using the FORCEGCBASIS keyword
    We perform the calculation in the standard input basis
     
    The Overall Screening threshold is set to              :  1.0000E-08
    The Screening threshold used for Coulomb               :  1.0000E-10
    The Screening threshold used for Exchange              :  1.0000E-08
    The Screening threshold used for One-electron operators:  1.0000E-15
    The SCF Convergence Criteria is applied to the gradnorm in OAO basis

    End of configuration!
